# 🧩 Sudoku Solver using Python and Backtracking

This project automatically solves Sudoku puzzles using the **Backtracking Algorithm**.  
It uses **Python** and **Pygame** to visualize the solving process step-by-step in a GUI.  
The algorithm fills the Sudoku grid logically, backtracking when a number doesn't fit.
